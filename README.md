# Angel List API

This script contains a simple __python class__ for making requests to the [Angel List API](https://angel.co/api). It is used here to find active investors in Washington, D.C. who have listed Twitter handles. The handles are exported to a text file which is used to automatically create a list on Twitter using the [Twitter command-line power tool](https://github.com/sferik/t).
